# New-to-Github-and-Coding
# I'm Jamie and I'm new to coding.
# I'm close to my 50th birthday and new things excite me and scare me at the same time.
# I'm tired of my old job and want to move onto something better.
# Ask me if you have any questions.
# I'm gay, I've been married 11 years to my husband Eric and we have 2 dogs.
# I have to puzzle things out for myself in order to understand how they work.
# Here's to trying new things.
